It takes any input — a single letter, a password, or a multi-gigabyte file — and produces a fixed 256-bit (64-character hexadecimal) output known as a <strong>hash</strong> or <strong>digest</strong>.</p> <p>Even if you change just one bit of the input, the resulting hash changes completely — a property called the <strong>avalanche effect</strong>. This makes SHA-256 effectively impossible to reverse or fake.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why SHA-256 Is Still Unbreakable in 2025</h2> <p>Despite quantum computing advances, no practical attack exists against SHA-256. Brute-forcing a collision would require more energy than the sun produces in a year. It is officially approved by NIST and used globally in:</p> <ul class="svelte-1tq17n3"><li>Bitcoin and all major blockchains</li> <li>SSL/TLS certificates (every HTTPS website)</li> <li>Git commit IDs</li> <li>Digital signatures (PGP, code signing)</li> <li>Secure password storage (with salt)</li> <li>File integrity verification</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">How AxelBase Uses Native Web Crypto API</h2> <p>Our tool runs 100% in your browser using the built-in <code>window.crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256")</code> API — the same implementation used by banks and governments. No data ever leaves your device. Zero tracking. Works offline after first load.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Is SHA-256 quantum resistant?</summary> <p>Yes — Grover’s algorithm offers only a quadratic speedup. Breaking SHA-256 would still require billions of years on a quantum computer.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why not use SHA-3?</summary> <p>SHA-3 is excellent, but SHA-256 has decades of real-world scrutiny and hardware acceleration in all modern CPUs.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Can I trust browser-based hashing?</summary> <p>Absolutely — when using the native Web Crypto API (like AxelBase does), the math is identical to OpenSSL or system libraries.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">SHA-256 isn’t going anywhere. It’s the gold standard of cryptographic hashing — and tools like AxelBase make it instantly accessible to everyone.</p></article></div>');function x(d){var e=w();f("1tq17n3",m=>{var s=A(),u=g(y(s),6);t(8),n(()=>o(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),v(()=>{b.title="What is SHA-256 and Why It Still Matters in 2025 | AxelBase Blog"}),i(m,s)});var a=r(e),h=r(a);t(4),l(a),t(2),l(e),n(()=>o(h,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(d,e)}export{x as component,B as universal};
