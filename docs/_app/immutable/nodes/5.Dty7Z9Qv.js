Even if they claim “no logging,” your private keys, passwords, or confidential documents travel over the internet — creating risk.</p> <p><strong>AxelBase is different.</strong> Every hash is computed entirely in your browser using the Web Crypto API. Nothing is uploaded. Nothing is stored. After the page loads once, it works completely offline.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">What “100% Client-Side” Really Means</h2> <ul class="svelte-1apmzc4"><li>No network requests after initial load (check DevTools → Network tab)</li> <li>No cookies, no analytics, no tracking pixels</li> <li>No server-side processing — ever</li> <li>Works in private browsing and with ad blockers</li> <li>Can be saved as a PWA and used forever offline</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Real-World Risks of Server-Side Tools</h2> <p>In 2024 alone, several popular hash generators were caught logging inputs. One leaked API keys worth millions. Another was exploited to steal private keys. With AxelBase, that attack surface simply doesn’t exist.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Can JavaScript be trusted for cryptography?</summary> <p>Yes — when using the standardized, hardware-accelerated Web Crypto API (same as banks use in-browser).</p></details> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why not just use Python/OpenSSL locally?</summary> <p>Most users don’t have them installed.
